Bugs:
Doesn't happen everytime.Increase a player, save. If increase10, then it increases as a string (i.e 10 (saved) + 10 = 1010, not the expected 20)

How to improve the app:
Not allowing empty input when clicking the "ready" button, resulting in an empty player name and a shift in layout.
Implementing a "add player" feature.
